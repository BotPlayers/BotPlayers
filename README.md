# BotPlayers

A simple yet effective framework for building up your own bots ü§ñ that live in a world üåè you defined!

## How to install?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BotPlayers/BotPlayers && cd BotPlayers
pip install -e .
```

## How to use the framework?

BotPlayers makes complex bot management feel like a walk in the park.

First, import the `agent_callable` decorator from `botplayers`.

```python
from botplayers import agent_callable, Agent
```

Then, define a function that can be called by agents.

1. The function must be decorated with `agent_callable`.
2. The function can have any number of arguments.
3. The function can return any JSON-serializable object.
4. **(IMPORTANT)** Tell agents how to call this function by writing a docstring.

```python
@agent_callable
def calculator(python_math_expression: str):
    """
    A simple calculator that can do basic math operations.

    Args:
        python_math_expression: a python math expression.
    """
    import math
    return {'result': eval(python_math_expression, {'math': math})}
```

Now, let's see how to call this function from agents.

Create an agent. Use prompt to tell agents what they can do.
You don't have to explicitly tell agents how to call functions.

```python
agent = Agent(
    name='Bot', 
    prompt="You are a helpful bot. You can use functions to accomplish tasks.",
    # tell agents what object they can interact with (this can be a list of functions or InteractiveSpace objects)
    interactive_objects=[calculator], 
    function_call_repeats=15, 
    ignore_none_function_messages=False)
```

Then, run the agent.

```python
user_message = "Could please tell me what is 234*(212-3456)/(121-21241)?"
agent.receive_message({'role': 'user', 'content': user_message})
agent.think_and_act()
```

Besides just calling stateless functions, bots can also interact with a **stateful and customized environment** easily through `InteractiveSpace`!
