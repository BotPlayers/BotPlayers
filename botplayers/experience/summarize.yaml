    In order to Turkify the local population, in June 1927 the Law 1164 was passed which allowed the creation of 
    Inspectorates-General (Turkish: Umumi Müffetişlik, UM). The Diyarbakır province was therefore included in the so-called 
    First Inspectorate General (Turkish: Birinci Umumi Müffetişlik), which span over the provinces of Hakkâri, Siirt, Van, 
    Mardin, Bitlis, Sanlıurfa, Elaziğ and Diyarbakır. The first UM was created on the 1 January 1928 and centered in Diyarbakır. 
    The UM was governed by an Inspector General, who governed with a wide-ranging authority over civilian, juridical and military matters. 
    The office of the Inspector General was dissolved in 1952 during the government of the Democrat Party. 
    The Diyarbakır province though was still banned for foreign citizens until 1965. Within the policy of turkification, 
    during the 1930s, several place-names in the province were renamed into names which denoted a Turkish origin.
